js-meal-planner
===============

A meal planner created to learn JS concepts, by using only vanilla JS and some of the newer concepts such as drag and drop and local storage.

This is a work in progress that I want to add to as I have time to continue to learn more JS. 

The design is bare bones since it is all about the JS for me right now, but eventually I want to use the app regularly in my life, so it will expand a bit.
